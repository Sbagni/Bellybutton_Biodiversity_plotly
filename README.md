# Bellybutton_Biodiversity_plotly

In this assignment, we built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.
(http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), this dataset catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study)
were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The interactive dashboard displays a bar chart, bubble graph and gauge chart.
